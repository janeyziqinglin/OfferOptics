# Design Document

## 1 Design Considerations

### 1.1 Assumptions

The system assumes that there will be only one user using the app, and no communication or data transfer is necessary between different devices. 

### 1.2 Constraints

There are no major constraints in the application.

### 1.3 System Environment

Hardware: The system is designed to operate on standard computer hardware, such as desktops, laptops, and mobile devices.
Software: The system is designed to operate on standard operating systems like Windows, macOS, Linux, and various mobile operating systems.

## 3 Low-Level Design

### 3.1 Class Diagram

*In the case of an OO design, the internal structure of a software component would typically be expressed as a UML class diagram that represents the static class structure for the component and their relationships.*

## 4 User Interface Design

The user interface is designed for the Android platform. It will adhere to the established Android design guidelines and incorporate industry best practices to deliver a seamless and user-friendly experience. The user interface will utilize a range of Android-specific components: buttons, text fields, lists, and navigation drawers and etc. Its layout and styling will ensure compatibility with diverse screen sizes and orientations.
